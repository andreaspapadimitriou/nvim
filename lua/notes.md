Maybe some automatic checks and installs.

if clipboard doesn't exist install something 
(e.g.)
sudo apt install xclip or sudo apt install xsel

if ripgrep not installed
sudo apt install ripgrep

if luarocks missing install it 
sudo apt install luarocks

if npm not found (might cause issues with prettier)
sudo apt install nodejs npm
